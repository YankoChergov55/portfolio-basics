# Portfolio Basics

This project is a simple web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to demonstrate the core concepts of front-end web development without the use of frameworks or advanced tools.

The goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of the fundamentals of web development, specifically:

- Structuring a webpage with **HTML**.
- Styling the webpage with **CSS**.
- Adding interactivity with **JavaScript**.

This is a minimalist approach to building a web app, focusing purely on the foundational technologies.
