					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						Hello! My name is Yanko, and I'm a web developer based in Sofia,
						Bulgaria. I'm 26 years old and currently expanding my skills in
						front-end web development, with a focus on HTML, CSS, and
						JavaScript. My goal is to continue advancing into more complex web
						technologies and frameworks as I grow in my career.
					</p>
					<p>
						This portfolio serves as a showcase of the projects I've worked on
						and the skills I've acquired so far. It's a work in progress, and
						I'll be continuously updating it as I complete new projects and
						learn new technologies.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and following sports,
						particularly American football and motorsports like the World
						Endurance Championship. I'm also an avid TV show watcher, with a
						special interest in the recent Star Wars series.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my
						projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!

					<h3 class="project-title">Vanilla Tasks</h3>
					<p>
						This is a project that uses the most basic HTML, CSS and JS without
						any frameworks. <br />
						It uses local storage for storing data in case the page gets
						refreshed. <br />
						It is used to solidify the basics of all 3 technologies without
						using anything complex. <br />
						In the future this can be upgraded with a proper database such as
						MongoDB, express.js for backend and React.js for frontend. <br />
